I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at The University of Toledo where I am also pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. My research focuses on High-performance computing (HPC) and Stochastic Modeling, Control, and Optimization. Specifically, I strive to innovate system software solutions for HPC systems to enhance their efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
